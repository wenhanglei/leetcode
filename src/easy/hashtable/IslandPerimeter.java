 * You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional

 * (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by 
 * water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more 
 * connected land cells). The island doesn't have "lakes" 
 * (water inside that isn't connected to the water around 
 * the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. 
 * The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. 
 * Determine the perimeter of the island.
